      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>My name is <strong>Lucain Miller</strong>. I'm 22 and live in <em>Vancouver, Washington</em>. I decided to learn programming to keep me entertained during covid-19 and to gain a skill I could apply to jobs later on.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include, video games, D&D, writing and art. I do digital art and pencil drawing mostly, and I like to write modern fantasy horror. In D&D, I play an scrouge aasimar, divine soul sorcerer named Balsam. The video games I like to play are usually sandbox and laid back, but I also like open world rpgs. If you can have pets in the game, I'll probably play it. My favorite game series is Pokemon, but my favorite game is Okami.</p>
